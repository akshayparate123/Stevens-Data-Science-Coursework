One notable project was developing a Python-based tool for detecting anomalies in large datasets, which significantly improved data quality and reliability. This experience not only honed my technical skills but also taught me the importance of clear communication and teamwork, as I collaborated closely with cross-functional teams to understand their data needs and deliver precise, actionable insights.

I am particularly drawn to the innovative and collaborative culture at Solar, where taking smart risks and learning from failures is encouraged. I am confident that my ability to independently learn new coding syntax, coupled with my strong analytical and problem-solving skills, will allow me to make meaningful contributions to your team.
