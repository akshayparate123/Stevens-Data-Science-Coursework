I am excited to apply for the Business Intelligence Internship - Fall 2024 at Medpace. With a strong academic background in data science and hands-on experience in business intelligence and data analytics, I am eager to contribute to your team and further develop my skills in a dynamic and innovative environment.

In my role as a Senior Consultant at LTIMindtree, I implemented DevOps automation, developed machine learning algorithms, and conducted data analysis to optimize server performance and resource utilization. I have extensive experience in Python, SQL, and various business intelligence tools such as Power BI and Tableau. These experiences have equipped me with the technical and analytical skills required for this internship.

At Medpace, I am particularly excited about the opportunity to support key business intelligence projects, create reports and dashboards using Power BI, and perform data quality audits. My experience in developing and maintaining BI reports, conducting data analysis, and utilizing advanced data wrangling techniques will enable me to contribute effectively to your team. Additionally, my familiarity with Microsoft's Data Platform and my proficiency in SQL and data manipulation align well with the skills and abilities required for this role.
